#Run code for compiling

#Plan for creating Peer Comparison Database in Tableau; this could be used in Excel using VLOOKUP or in similar ways, but
# Tableau is our tool of choice and I should focus on this

#Components:
# (1) Long and Lean data file with UNITID, frequencies (if coded columns for level, etc.), varname, data, year/FY/survey info
# (2) Header info; link on UNITID to have all info; need to compile to include athletic conference
# (3) Variable information (variable label, description

#First step - create header file (?)
# I might add to this later (i.e. add from IC info about athletic conference), but just use regular info for now


#Next step
#Create compiled long and lean data file
